## The R syntax

_Start by showing an example of a script_

* Point to the different parts:
  - a function
  - the assignment operator `<-`
  - the `=` for arguments
  - the comments `#` and how they are used to document function and its content
  - the `$` operator
* Point to indentation and consistency in spacing to improve clarity

## Assignment operator

`<-` is the assignment operator. Assigns values on the right to objects on the
left, it is like an arrow that points from the value to the object. Mostly
similar to `=` but not always. Learn to use `<-` as it is good programming
practice. Using `=` in place of `<-` can lead to issues down the line.

In RStudio, typing `Alt + -` (push `Alt`, the key next to your space bar at the
same time as the `-` key) will write ` <- ` in a single keystroke.

`=` should only be used to specify the values of arguments in functions for
instance `read.csv(file="put_some_data_here")`.

## Creating objects

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Creating objects (assignments)
```
You can get output from R simply by typing in math in the console

```{r, purl=FALSE}
3 + 5
12/7
```

However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign _values_ to
_objects_. To create objects, we need to give it a name followed by the
assignment operator `<-` and the value we want to give it:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 55
```

Objects can be given any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or
`subject_id`. You want your object names to be explicit and not too long. They
cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid but `x2` is). R is case sensitive
(e.g., `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`). There are some names that
cannot be used because they represent the names of fundamental functions in R
(e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, see
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)
for a complete list). In general, even if it's allowed, it's best to not use
other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`, `weights`). In doubt
check the help to see if the name is already in use. It's also best to avoid
dots (`.`) within a variable name as in `my.dataset`. It is also recommended to
use nouns for variable names, and verbs for function names.

When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force to
print the value by using parentheses or by typing the name:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
(weight_kg <- 55)
weight_kg
```

Now that R has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For
instance, we may want to convert this weight in pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2
times the weight in kg):

```{r, purl=FALSE}
2.2 * weight_kg
```

We can also change a variable's value by assigning it a new one:


```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

This means that assigning a value to one variable does not change the values of
other variables.  For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a
variable.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
```

and then change `weight_kg` to 100.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 100
```

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`? 126.5 or 200?

### Exercise

What are the values after each statement in the following?

```{r, purl=FALSE}
mass <- 47.5           # mass?
age  <- 122            # age?
mass <- mass * 2.0     # mass?
age  <- age - 20       # age?
massIndex <- mass/age  # massIndex?
```

## Vectors and data types

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Vectors and data types
```

A vector is the most common and basic data structure in R, and is pretty much
the workhorse of R. It's a group of values, mainly either numbers or
characters. You can assign this list of values to a variable, just like you
would for one item. For example we can create a vector of animal weights:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weights <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weights
```

A vector can also contain characters:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
animals
```

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a
vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
length(weights)
length(animals)
```

`class()` indicates the class (the type of element) of an object:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
class(weights)
class(animals)
```

The function `str()` provides an overview of the object and the elements it
contains. It is a really useful function when working with large and complex
objects:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
str(weights)
str(animals)
```

You can add elements to your vector simply by using the `c()` function:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weights <- c(weights, 90) # adding at the end
weights <- c(30, weights) # adding at the beginning
weights
```

What happens here is that we take the original vector `weights`, and we are
adding another item first to the end of the other ones, and then another item at
the beginning. We can do this over and over again to build a vector or a
dataset. As we program, this may be useful to autoupdate results that we are
collecting or calculating.

We just saw 2 of the 6 **data types** that R uses: `"character"` and
`"numeric"`. The other 4 are:
* `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)
* `"integer"` for integer numbers (e.g., `2L`, the `L` indicates to R that it's an integer)
* `"complex"` to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g.,
  `1+4i`) and that's all we're going to say about them
* `"raw"` that we won't discuss further

Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that R uses. Other important
ones are lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames (`data.frame`) and
factors (`factor`).

## Functions and their arguments

Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually take in data, process it, and return a result.
Let's look at a simple function call below `read.csv`. This function is used to read in data from a csv file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
metadata <- read.csv(file="meta/mouse_exp_design.csv")
```
_Autocomplete: When typing out the function call try pressing the `Tab` key after typing only `read`. You will see a drop-down menu appear offering you a list of read functions that are available for use. The window to the right gives you more information on the function and its arguments as you scroll down and highlight each individually._ 

The `file=` part inside the parentheses is called an argument, and most
functions use arguments. Arguments modify the behavior of the
function. Typically, they take some input (e.g., some data, an object) and other
options to change what the function will return, or how to treat the data
provided.

Most functions can take several arguments, but most are specified by default so
you don't have to enter them. To see these default values, you can either type
`args(read.csv)` or look at the help for this function (e.g., `?read.csv`).

```{r, results='show'}
args(read.csv)
```

If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you
don't have to name them:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read.csv(file="meta/mouse_exp_design.csv", header=TRUE) # is identical to:
read.csv("meta/mouse_exp_design.csv", TRUE)
```

However, it's usually not recommended practice because it's a lot of remembering
to do, and if you share your code with others that includes less known functions
it makes your code difficult to read. (It's however OK to not include the names
of the arguments for basic functions like `mean`, `min`, etc...)

Another advantage of naming arguments, is that the order doesn't matter:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read.csv(file="meta/mouse_exp_design.csv", header=TRUE) # is identical to:
read.csv(header=TRUE, file="meta/mouse_exp_design.csv")
```
